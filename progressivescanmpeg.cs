To handle progressive scan for MPEG videos in C#, you can use FFmpeg, which is a powerful tool for video processing. Here's a simple example of how you might use FFmpeg from C# to convert an interlaced video to progressive scan:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

public void ConvertToProgressive(string inputPath, string outputPath)
{
    var ffmpegPath = "path/to/ffmpeg"; // Path to your ffmpeg executable
    var arguments = $"-i {inputPath} -vf \"yadif=0:-1:0\" {outputPath}";

    var process = new Process
    {
        StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo
        {
            FileName = ffmpegPath,
            Arguments = arguments,
            RedirectStandardOutput = true,
            UseShellExecute = false,
            CreateNoWindow = true,
        }
    };

    process.Start();
    process.WaitForExit();
}
```

In this example, the `yadif` filter is used to deinterlace the video, converting it to progressive scan. Make sure you have FFmpeg installed and the path to the executable is correct.

If you need more advanced video processing capabilities, you might want to look into libraries like [AForge.NET](https://github.com/andrewkirillov/AForge.NET) or [Accord.NET](https://github.com/accord-net/framework), which provide extensive tools for image and video processing.

Are you working on a specific project that requires progressive scan conversion? Let me know if you need further assistance!
