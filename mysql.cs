To create a MySQL connector in C#, you can use the MySQL Connector/NET, which is a .NET data provider for MySQL. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

1. **Download and Install MySQL Connector/NET**:
   - You can download the latest version of MySQL Connector/NET from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/)¹.

2. **Create a new C# project**:
   - Open Visual Studio and create a new Console App (.NET Core or .NET Framework).

3. **Add the MySQL Connector/NET package**:
   - You can add the package via NuGet Package Manager:
     ```bash
     Install-Package MySql.Data
     ```

4. **Write the code to connect to MySQL**:
   - Add the necessary imports:
     ```csharp
     using System;
     using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;
     ```

   - Write the code to establish a connection and perform a simple query:
     ```csharp
     class Program
     {
         static void Main(string[] args)
         {
             string connectionString = "server=your_server;user=your_user;database=your_database;port=3306;password=your_password";
             using (var connection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString))
             {
                 try
                 {
                     connection.Open();
                     Console.WriteLine("Connection successful!");

                     string sql = "SELECT * FROM your_table";
                     MySqlCommand cmd = new MySqlCommand(sql, connection);
                     MySqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();

                     while (rdr.Read())
                     {
                         Console.WriteLine($"{rdr[0]} -- {rdr[1]}");
                     }
                     rdr.Close();
                 }
                 catch (Exception ex)
                 {
                     Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Run your application**:
   - Make sure your MySQL server is running and the connection string is correctly configured with your server details.

This example demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL database, execute a query, and read the results. For more detailed examples and advanced usage, you can refer to the [MySQL Connector/NET Developer Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/)².
