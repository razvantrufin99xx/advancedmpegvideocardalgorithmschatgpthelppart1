If you're looking to handle interlaced video in C#, you can use FFmpeg for deinterlacing. Here's a simple example of how you might call FFmpeg from C# to deinterlace a video:

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

public void DeinterlaceVideo(string inputPath, string outputPath)
{
    var ffmpegPath = "path/to/ffmpeg"; // Path to your ffmpeg executable
    var arguments = $"-i {inputPath} -vf yadif {outputPath}";

    var process = new Process
    {
        StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo
        {
            FileName = ffmpegPath,
            Arguments = arguments,
            RedirectStandardOutput = true,
            UseShellExecute = false,
            CreateNoWindow = true,
        }
    };

    process.Start();
    process.WaitForExit();
}
```

This code uses the `yadif` filter in FFmpeg to deinterlace the video. Make sure you have FFmpeg installed and the path to the executable is correct.

If you need more advanced video processing capabilities, you might want to look into libraries like [AForge.NET](https://github.com/andrewkirillov/AForge.NET) or [Accord.NET](https://github.com/accord-net/framework), which provide extensive tools for image and video processing.

Are you working on a specific project that requires deinterlacing? Let me know if you need further assistance!
