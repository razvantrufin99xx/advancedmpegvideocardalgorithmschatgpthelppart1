Sure! Here's a simple example of how you can calculate the numerical derivative of a function in C# using finite differences:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Define the function to differentiate
        Func<double, double> function = x => Math.Sin(x);

        // Point at which to evaluate the derivative
        double x = Math.PI / 4;

        // Step size
        double h = 1e-5;

        // Calculate the derivative
        double derivative = NumericalDerivative(function, x, h);

        Console.WriteLine($"The derivative of sin(x) at x = {x} is approximately: {derivative}");
    }

    static double NumericalDerivative(Func<double, double> f, double x, double h)
    {
        return (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2 * h);
    }
}
```

This code defines a function \( f(x) = \sin(x) \) and calculates its derivative at \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \) using the central difference method with a small step size \( h \). You can modify the function and the point of evaluation as needed.
