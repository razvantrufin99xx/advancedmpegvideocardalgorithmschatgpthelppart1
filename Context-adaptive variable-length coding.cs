Context-adaptive variable-length coding (CAVLC) is a form of entropy coding used in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video encoding. Implementing CAVLC in C# can be quite complex due to the detailed bit-level operations involved. Below is a simplified example to give you an idea of how you might start implementing CAVLC in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class CAVLC
{
    public static void Encode(int[] coefficients)
    {
        List<int> encodedData = new List<int>();

        // Example: Encode the number of non-zero coefficients
        int nonZeroCount = 0;
        foreach (var coeff in coefficients)
        {
            if (coeff != 0)
                nonZeroCount++;
        }
        encodedData.Add(nonZeroCount);

        // Example: Encode the coefficients
        foreach (var coeff in coefficients)
        {
            if (coeff != 0)
            {
                encodedData.Add(coeff);
            }
        }

        // Output the encoded data
        Console.WriteLine("Encoded Data: " + string.Join(", ", encodedData));
    }

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] coefficients = { 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1 };
        Encode(coefficients);
    }
}
```

This example is highly simplified and does not cover the full complexity of CAVLC, such as handling zig-zag ordering, run-level coding, or context adaptation. For a complete implementation, you would need to follow the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard specifications¹².

If you need more detailed guidance or have specific requirements, feel free to ask! Are you working on a particular project that requires CAVLC implementation?
